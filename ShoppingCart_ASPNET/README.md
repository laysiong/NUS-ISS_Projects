# Shopping Cart Web Application

## Overview
This is a **Shopping Cart** web application developed using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture. The project simulates the functionality of a shopping cart without the need for a database. It was built to provide a dynamic shopping cart experience where users can add, update, and remove items.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **C# (ASP.NET MVC)**: The backend logic that handles shopping cart operations, user input, and manages the flow of data between the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and layout of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Manages dynamic behavior for updating the cart in real time.

### Tools
- **Visual Studio**: IDE for developing the C# application.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in the project.

## Features
- **Add to Cart**: Users can select items and add them to the shopping cart.
- **Update Quantity**: Users can modify the quantity of items in the cart.
- **Remove Items**: Users can remove items from the cart.
- **View Total Cost**: The total amount is updated dynamically as items are added, removed, or updated.
- **Session Management**: Simple session management is used to persist the shopping cart contents.

## System Architecture
This application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

- **Model**: Represents the data (shopping cart, products, etc.).
- **View**: The frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) displays the shopping cart and product details.
- **Controller**: Handles requests, processes user inputs, and updates the Model accordingly.

The application does not use a database. Instead, it relies on in-memory data structures or session variables to store and manage the shopping cartâ€™s contents.

## Usage
- **Add to Cart**: Select items to add them to the shopping cart.
- **Update Quantity**: Modify the quantity of items in the cart.
- **Remove Items**: Remove any item from the cart.
- **View Total**: The total amount will be updated dynamically as items are added, removed, or updated.

## Contributors
This project was developed by a team of six members, each contributing to different aspects such as backend development using C#, frontend design with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, user interface functionality, and project management.
