Shopping Cart Web Application
Overview
This is a Shopping Cart web application developed using Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The project simulates the functionality of a shopping cart without the need for a database. It was built with:

Backend: C# (ASP.NET MVC)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
The goal of the project is to provide a dynamic shopping cart experience where users can add, update, and remove items.

Features
Add items to the shopping cart.
Update the quantity of items in the cart.
Remove items from the cart.
Calculate the total cost dynamically.
Simple session management for shopping cart persistence.
Technologies Used
Backend
C# (ASP.NET MVC): The backend logic that handles the shopping cart operations, user input, and manages the flow of data between the frontend and the backend.
Frontend
HTML: Structure of the web pages.
CSS: Styling and layout of the user interface.
JavaScript: Dynamic behavior for updating the cart in real time.
Tools
Visual Studio: IDE for developing the C# application.
Git: Version control for tracking changes in the project.
System Architecture
This application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

Model: Represents the data (shopping cart, products, etc.).
View: Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) that displays the shopping cart and product details.
Controller: Handles requests, processes user inputs, and updates the Model accordingly.
The application does not use a database. Instead, it relies on in-memory data structures or session variables to store and manage the shopping cart's contents.

Usage
Add to Cart: Select items to add them to the shopping cart.
Update Quantity: Modify the quantity of items in the cart.
Remove Items: Remove any item from the cart.
View Total: The total amount will be updated dynamically as items are added, removed, or updated.
